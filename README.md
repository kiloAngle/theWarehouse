Mostly, I'm hoping to customize my code to improve user functionality.
I appreciate all feedback and advice.
I look forward to being part of the gitHub community.

My first attempt here is connectivity between sqlLite and my eclipse front-end.
Ver1 is located within this repository. 
I'll be updating my readme often, and will be adding my responses here.

Thank you for reading
